# Releasing tailcat

Releases are cut by pushing a version tag. GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) then runs
[GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) with the config in
`.goreleaser.yaml`, which builds the artifacts and publishes a GitHub
Release with a changelog generated from the commit log.

## Cutting a release

1. Make sure the Test workflow is green on `main`.
2. Run the release script, which creates an SSH-signed annotated tag
   after checking that the tag doesn't already exist on origin (a tag
   that exists only locally is replaced). It requires git's
   `user.signingkey` to be set to your SSH public key.

   ```sh
   ./tag.sh v0.1.0
   ```

3. Push the tag as the script instructs:

   ```sh
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

4. Watch the Release workflow in the Actions tab. When it finishes,
   the release with all artifacts appears on the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/tailscale/tailcat/releases).

## Artifacts

Each release contains:

* Linux static binaries (tar.gz) for amd64, arm64, and armv7
* Debian (.deb) and RPM (.rpm) packages for the same architectures
* macOS binaries (tar.gz) for arm64
* Windows binaries (zip) for amd64 and arm64
* `checksums.txt` with SHA-256 checksums of the above

Each release also pushes container images (amd64 and arm64) to
[ghcr.io/tailscale/tailcat](https://github.com/tailscale/tailcat/pkgs/container/tailcat), tagged
both `vX.Y.Z` and `latest`. The image is the static binary in a
[distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) base
image; see `Dockerfile.goreleaser`.

The binary version is embedded at build time via `-ldflags -X
main.version=...`; `tailcat version` prints it. Builds made with
`go install github.com/tailscale/tailcat/cmd/tailcat@vX.Y.Z` instead
report the module version from the Go build info.

## Testing locally

To build everything without tagging or publishing, install
[GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) and run:

```sh
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

The artifacts land in `dist/` (which is gitignored). In snapshot mode
the container images are built into the local Docker daemon as
separate per-platform tags rather than a multi-arch manifest, and
nothing is pushed. Building them requires a buildx builder with the
docker-container driver (`docker buildx create --use`).
